Given the rise of smart electricity meters and the wide adoption of electricity generation technology like solar panels, there is a wealth of electricity usage data available.

This data represents a multivariate time series of power-related variables that in turn could be used to model and even forecast future electricity consumption.

Unlike other machine learning algorithms, long short-term memory recurrent neural networks are capable of automatically learning features from sequence data, support multiple-variate data, and can output a variable length sequences that can be used for multi-step forecasting.

In this tutorial, you will discover how to develop long short-term memory recurrent neural networks for multi-step time series forecasting of household power consumption.

After completing this tutorial, you will know:

How to develop and evaluate Univariate and multivariate Encoder-Decoder LSTMs for multi-step time series forecasting.
How to develop and evaluate an CNN-LSTM Encoder-Decoder model for multi-step time series forecasting.
How to develop and evaluate a ConvLSTM Encoder-Decoder model for multi-step time series forecasting.
